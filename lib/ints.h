#define ISR_STACK_SIZE 1024

/* SwitchStack() should be called at the start of an ISR function to swap
 * out the stack pointer to point to the isr_stack_space memory block.
 *
 * When an interrupt is serviced, CS and DS are restored so that all our
 * pointers work as expected, but unless we do something, SS:SP still points
 * to the calling program's stack. This means that pointers to data on the
 * stack do not resolve correctly, since DS != SS. While it is possible to
 * carefully avoid taking pointers to anything on the stack, it tends to be
 * fragile and error-prone, with confusing bugs that are hard to track
 * down.  isr_stack_space is located in our data segment so we can set
 * SS = DS while the interrupt is being serviced.
 *
 * After switching to the new stack we push the old SS, SP and BP register
 * values; RestoreStack() will pop them off and restore the old stack.
