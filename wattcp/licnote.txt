At the time of writing in 2019 the WATTCP website has a version for download
that is not under the GNU Library GPL; however, it was definitely released
under that license in 2004 under the filename wat1104.zip and that is the
version being used here. Evidence can be found on the archive.org copy of the
WATTCP website:

> There are two free WATTCP distributions, one for real mode DOS, and a
> second which emphasizes 32 bit protected mode DOS. Both are GPL software.
